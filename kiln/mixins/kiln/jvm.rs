// Kiln's JVM: Java in a process of its own, beside the game's. The game's code forbids `unsafe`
// (`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` in horizon-client), so a native mod can't load a JVM into the game's process
// through JNI; Kiln runs `java kiln.Host` instead and talks to it over its stdin and stdout, a command a
// line (kiln/java/kiln/Host.java has the protocol). The window's game never waits on Java: one thread writes
// the commands from a bounded queue, another reads the replies into a channel the game drains each tick, so a
// slow or stuck mod never stalls the game. A mod stuck for longer than the queue holds stops Java.
//
// The integrated server's game asks Java things and waits for the answer (`ServerLink::call`), at most a
// timeout: its answers (`return`) come on a channel of their own, and so do Java's questions about the world while a
// call runs (`ask`), which the waiting server answers.
